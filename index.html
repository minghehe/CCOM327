<p>
My name is Minghe Hu. My major is Communications, specialized in Journalism of Technology and Business. I am currently on my last year at 
Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). My home country is China. I grew up in a dessert area, where the blue sky and loess are so remarkable 
and pure that I could not find any other place like it. From a place that can not even be found in Chinese map, I moved to cities that are much 
bigger and crowded. I started a journey to looking for myself and exploring the world four years ago. Different cultures did not scare me. 
Experience abroad always taught me a lot. It made me learn more about myself and encourage me to keep going on.

To be a journalist, is not only a dream job for me from childhood, also it fits me more and more during the education and experience I am having. 
I studied Spanish language and literature, and it brought me to a broader world. I went to studied in Spain. I made friends in Paris, Barcelona. 
I walked on the streets of Rio de Janeiro and Chicago. I am curious about the life of people and I want to help people to make their own voice be 
heard, to confront the barrier of boundary between countries and have a fairly happy life like everyone of us deserve. I strongly feel that I am 
part of the world more than ever before. Diversity of knowledge and broad cultural vision is what I need.

In IIT, I started to absorb acknowledge of the field I was not familiar with. Area of natural science and programming opened a door for me to 
new possibilities. It shows me my knowledge weakness and what the world need from a professional journalist. Working and studying with people 
who has diversity backgrounds make me keep thinking out of box. IIT provides me with prefect chance to hear people who came from different parts 
of the world. From here, I learned to respect and understand different ideas. I believe that people could harvest what they plant. The valuable 
mute-cultural working experience would be a part of me and be used in my professional career.

Internet development requires a media professional could connect the real world with the digital one. Getting to know how a web is designed 
is from my interests and the necessity from my future profession. In this class, I hope to deep my knowledge in web development, html and css, 
learn different platforms like Github and basecamp, and also have contact with Linux computers. This course will be a challenge for me. However, 
life is full of uncertainty. Challenge would just be another station.
